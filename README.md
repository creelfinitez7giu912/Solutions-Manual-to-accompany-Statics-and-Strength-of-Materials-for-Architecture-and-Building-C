  * Statics and Strength of Materials for Architecture and Building Construction, Fourth Edition, offers students an accessible, visually oriented introduction to structural theory that doesn't rely on calculus. Instead, illustrations and examples of building frameworks and components enable students to better visualize the connection between theoretical concepts and the experiential nature of real buildings and materials. This new edition includes fully worked examples in each chapter, a companion website with extra practice problems, and expanded treatment of load tracing.
